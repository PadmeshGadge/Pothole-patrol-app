# Pothole-patrol-app
App's main purpose is to allow user to capture photos of potholes and their locations and upload it to the server where authorities can address the issue.
Following android based app allows user to register and login on a server database and user can then add images from the camera or gallery.
The app also uploads the location of the phone to the database and basically maps that location to the image captured.
User can view a map inbuilt in the app which points out all the pothole areas added by other users.
Another beta feature in the app is to access the phone's accelerometer when the phone is in the car and detect pothole when car goes through the pothole and instantly upload that location to the server.
